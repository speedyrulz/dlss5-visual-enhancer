## Changes in this fork

This fork ([speedyrulz/dlss5-visual-enhancer](https://github.com/speedyrulz/dlss5-visual-enhancer)) tracks upstream (GPU selection, DLSS Frame Generation, the live pipeline, and the modular src/ layout) and adds fixes and performance work on top:

- **Correct automatic GPU on multi-GPU systems:** the native worker binds the first NVIDIA adapter in *DXGI* order (the primary display's card), which need not match `nvidia-smi` order. Upstream's automatic AI GPU pick follows `nvidia-smi`, so on a mixed-generation dual-GPU system it can stage the DLSS architecture runtime for one card while the worker renders on the other, and feature-18 creation then fails with `0xbad00001`. This fork enumerates DXGI adapters, matches them to GPUs by LUID, and picks the card the worker will actually bind, so the staged architecture DLL and the reports match the rendering GPU.
- **Adapter verification:** after the worker handshake, the session reads back which Direct3D adapter the worker actually bound. An explicit AI Processing GPU selection the worker could not honor fails fast with a clear message instead of silently rendering on the wrong card; automatic selection corrects the reported GPU.
- **Legacy codec migration:** upstream's codec names now distinguish CPU (`H.264`) from NVENC (`H.264 (NVIDIA NVENC)`), but a pre-v6 `config.ini` used the plain name to mean "NVENC when available". Loading such a config now maps it to the NVENC variant instead of silently downgrading every render to CPU encoding; configs written by v6 are respected verbatim.
- **Worker send/receive overlap:** a dedicated sender thread keeps one frame in flight inside the native worker's pipe while the main thread drains results, so the large per-frame upload overlaps DLSS evaluation instead of serializing with it.
- **Smarter automatic Video Processing GPU:** with two or more cards, the automatic video-GPU choice prefers a card other than the AI Processing GPU when it has at least 2 GB of free VRAM (fresh query), so NVENC does not compete with the DLSS render; single-GPU systems and explicit selections behave as upstream.
- **Timestamp monotonicity guard:** upstream's writer keeps the source time base (fixing the VFR dts-collision crash this fork originally carried); this fork additionally bumps genuinely duplicated source timestamps and reports the count as `pts_collisions_adjusted`.
- **Better failure diagnostics:** if the video encoder process dies (video render or frame interpolation), the error names the encoder, exit code, and frame, and includes FFmpeg's stderr; failure reports gain an `encoder_log` section.

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Merserk/dlss5-visual-enhancer/releases/latest).
2. Unpack the downloaded ZIP archive.
3. Run `start.bat`.

## Main features

- **Images:** single-image and batch processing with per-file success/failure results, responsive input/output previews, individual downloads, a ZIP of successful outputs, batch manifests, and diagnostic JSON reports.
- **Image formats:** common Pillow formats plus HEIF/HEIC, SVG, and many camera RAW formats. Outputs are PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF, or TIFF.
- **Image handling:** EXIF orientation is applied; ICC input is converted to sRGB; supported EXIF, DPI, and XMP metadata is retained; alpha is preserved except when JPEG composites it over white. EXIF/TIFF rational values and other unusual metadata are converted safely for diagnostic JSON without modifying the metadata used to encode the output. Animated and multipage files use only the first frame/page.
- **Video:** single-video and batch-video Neural Rendering, plus one-frame and three-second previews for a single selected video. H.264, H.265, AV1, and ProRes Proxy are available in MP4, MKV, or MOV where compatible, each in a plain CPU variant or an `(NVIDIA NVENC)` GPU variant (except ProRes Proxy, which is CPU-only).
- **Frame Interpolation:** single-video and batch-video processing with NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, selectable output rates from 23.976 to 480 FPS, and a three-second preview for a single selected video. The processing pipeline now overlaps more of the decode, motion-guide, Frame Generation, and encode work for substantially higher throughput.
- **Live:** watch local videos, direct network streams, YouTube, and Twitch with DLSS 5 Neural Rendering applied during playback. NR Preset, NR Style, intensity, tone, structure, skin structure, Automatic Mask, and DLSS Model Preset changes can be applied while playback is running without restarting the Live session.
- **Live playback controls:** Source quality, processing height from 480p to 4K, Auto/Source/60/30/24 FPS modes, adjustable playback buffering, Fast or Quality motion guides, and optional automatic playback in the bundled MPV player. Upscaling and source/playback configuration changes apply on the next Start.
- **Direct disk batch processing:** Image, Video, and Frame Interpolation tabs accept an absolute Input path for a file or folder and an optional Output path. Folder processing uses supported files in that folder only, sorted by filename. When either path is used, previews and browser downloads are disabled and results are written directly to disk.
- **Batch progress:** every file has its own Queued, Running, Complete, Failed, Cancelled, or Skipped state with percentage, elapsed time, output path, and processing details. Completed files are preserved if a batch is stopped, while the active incomplete output is cleaned up safely.
- **Single-only video previews:** input and output players are shown when exactly one uploaded video is selected. They are hidden for multi-video batches and direct disk mode. The final-render player follows the Preview Encoding setting: Auto may show an H.264 derivative when the result itself is not browser-playable, while Disabled always shows the actual file.
- **Media preservation:** frame timestamps and display rotation are handled; original metadata and chapters are copied. MKV copies compatible audio and subtitle streams, while MP4/MOV convert audio to 192 kbps AAC. Frame Interpolation also preserves supported text subtitles in MP4/MOV.
- **GPU selection:** AI Processing and Video Processing GPUs can be selected separately. The AI GPU is used for DLSS Neural Rendering and Frame Generation; the Video GPU is used only for codecs suffixed `(NVIDIA NVENC)`, while plain H.264/H.265/AV1 and ProRes Proxy remain CPU-based. Automatic selection is available for both.
- **DLSS 5 Architecture:** selectable Neural Rendering runtime builds are available for Turing and higher, Ada Lovelace and higher, and Blackwell and higher. Auto selects the matching build from the chosen AI Processing GPU, with RTX 20/30 using Turing+, RTX 40 using Ada Lovelace+, and RTX 50 using Blackwell+.
- **Preview Encoding:** a Settings-tab control for how in-app video previews are produced on the Video and Frame Interpolation tabs (preview buttons and final-render player). Auto uses the result directly when the browser can play it (MP4 + H.264, verified by probe) and otherwise creates an H.264 preview; Always H.264 always generates a browser-compatible preview; Disabled never creates one and sends the actual file to the browser. Non-H.264 previews can be slower and larger.
- **HDR Mode:** an opt-in 10-bit output that copies the input colorspace and keeps HDR when the input is HDR. It is available only for H.265, AV1, and ProRes Proxy; H.264 stays 8-bit SDR. Frame Interpolation accepts SDR video only unless HDR Mode is enabled.
- **GPU compatibility:** RTX compatibility is no longer restricted by a fixed Ampere, Ada, and Blackwell allowlist. RTX hardware is detected first, while architecture information is used for runtime selection and diagnostics. Actual DLSS and Frame Generation feature availability is determined by the installed NVIDIA runtime and driver.
- **Render metadata:** Image and Video Neural Rendering outputs can store the applied DLSS 5 settings in supported output metadata without replacing existing user descriptions. Video metadata notes are supported for MP4 and MKV outputs.
- **Renaming:** Image, Video, and Frame Interpolation outputs support Auto timestamped naming, Copy naming with the original base filename, or a Custom suffix. Existing outputs are never overwritten.
- **Safety and diagnostics:** only one GPU render runs at a time. Stop cancels active workers and encoders, completed batch outputs are retained, incomplete outputs are cleaned up, and finished files are published only after the relevant render path and output properties are verified.
- **Persistent controls:** Image, Video, and Live share Neural Rendering settings and the DLSS Model Preset. Frame Interpolation settings, HDR Mode selections, Preview Encoding, DLSS 5 Architecture, and GPU selections are also saved in `config.ini`. Settings presets can be exported to or imported from JSON, and Reset restores the relevant controls to their defaults. Live source, quality, buffering, and playback controls are session-local.

The application creates `outputs/`, `logs/`, `jobs/`, and `live/` when needed. Successful media is written to `outputs/`, reports and manifests to `logs/`, temporary active-render data to `jobs/`, and temporary Live session data to `live/`. Old cache and abandoned Live session data is cleaned up automatically.

## Requirements

- 64-bit Windows 11 with Direct3D 12.
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU with a compatible NVIDIA driver. Auto DLSS Architecture selection recognizes RTX 20/30, RTX 40, and RTX 50 generations, while unusual or newer RTX hardware is allowed to continue to runtime feature detection instead of being rejected only because its architecture metadata is unknown.
- Frame Interpolation requires a GPU, driver, and NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation runtime combination that reports Frame Generation support. Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling (HAGS) should be enabled; if it is disabled, the app reports it as a diagnostic and lets the runtime determine whether Frame Generation can start.
- Live local files and direct stream URLs use the portable media tools included with the application. YouTube and Twitch page URLs require the bundled `yt-dlp`, while automatic playback requires the bundled MPV player or can be disabled with **Open in MPV**.

## Settings

| Neural control | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NR Preset | Default, Preset #1, Preset #2, Preset #3 | Default |
| NR Style | Default, Natural, Cinematic | Default |
| NR Intensity | 0.00–2.00 | 1.00 |
| Local Tone Strength | 0.00–2.00 | 1.00 |
| Local Structure Strength | 0.00–2.00 | 1.00 |
| Skin Structure Strength | -1.00–2.00 | -1.00 (native default) |
| Automatic Mask | Off, On | Off |

The preset numbers are experimental native model hints; their visual effect is content-dependent.

| DLSS Model Preset | SDK value | Behavior |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Default | 0 | Applies no override and lets NVIDIA choose its normal mode-specific preset |
| J | 10 | Forces preset J for every supported DLSS scaling mode |
| K | 11 | Forces preset K for every supported DLSS scaling mode |
| L | 12 | Forces preset L for every supported DLSS scaling mode |
| M | 13 | Forces preset M for every supported DLSS scaling mode |

The DLSS Model Preset is independent of the experimental Neural Rendering **NR Preset** control.

| Upscaling mode | Factor | Behavior |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| DLAA / native | 1× | Keeps the source dimensions |
| Quality | 1.5× | Produces 1.5× output dimensions |
| Balanced | 1.724× | Produces approximately 1.724× output dimensions |
| Performance | 2× | Produces 2× output dimensions |
| Ultra Performance | 3× | Produces 3× output dimensions |

Output dimensions are rounded to even pixels and limited to a 7680×4320 boundary.

| Frame Interpolation setting | Choices and behavior | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output FPS | 23.976, 25, 29.97, 30, 50, 59.94, 60, 90, 119.88, 120, 144, 165, 180, 240, 360, or 480 FPS | 60 |
| DLSS engine | Auto, Native DLSSG, or Cascade | Auto |
| Video codec | H.264, H.265, AV1, or ProRes Proxy, each in a plain CPU variant or an `(NVIDIA NVENC)` GPU variant (ProRes Proxy is CPU-only) | H.264 |
| Container | MP4, MKV, or MOV; ProRes Proxy requires MKV or MOV | MP4 |
| Encoding quality | Auto (Default), Good, Best, or Max | Auto (Default) |
| HDR Mode | Off, On; 10-bit output that copies the input colorspace; H.265 / AV1 / ProRes only | Off |
| Rename | Auto adds a DLSSFG timestamp; Copy keeps the original base name; Custom appends the entered suffix | Auto |

`Auto` uses a supported exact native DLSSG grid when possible and the cascade path when required. If the selected output FPS is equal to or below the source rate, source frames are resampled without generating additional frames.

| Live setting | Choices and behavior | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source | Online URL or Local video | Online |
| Source quality | Auto, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p, or 2160p | Auto |
| Max input height | 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p, or 2160p before DLSS processing | 720p |
| Segment length | 1, 2, or 4 seconds | 2 seconds |
| Live frame rate | Auto, Source, 60, 30, or 24 FPS | Auto |
| Playback buffer | 2–30 seconds | 6 seconds |
| Motion guide quality | Fast or Quality | Fast |
| Open in MPV | Off, On | On |

Live Neural Rendering controls and the DLSS Model Preset are shared with the Image and Video tabs. Effect controls can update during playback, while the upscaling factor and Live source/playback controls take effect on the next Start.

| Output setting | Choices and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Image format | PNG/TIFF are lossless; JPEG/WebP/AVIF use the 1–100 quality control (default 95) |
| Video codec | H.264, H.265, AV1, or ProRes Proxy, each in a plain CPU variant or an `(NVIDIA NVENC)` GPU variant (ProRes Proxy is CPU-only) |
| Container | MP4, MKV, or MOV; ProRes Proxy requires MKV or MOV |
| Encoding quality | Auto (Default) uses resolution/FPS/codec; Good = Auto×2; Best = Auto×4; Max uses CQ/CRF 0; ProRes uses its fixed Proxy profile |
| HDR Mode | Off, On; 10-bit output that copies the input colorspace; H.265 / AV1 / ProRes only |
| Rename | Auto adds the DLSS5 timestamp; Copy keeps the original base name; Custom appends the entered suffix before the output extension |

Plain H.264/H.265/AV1 are CPU-based (libx264 / libx265 / libsvtav1) and never require a GPU. Only codecs suffixed `(NVIDIA NVENC)` need working NVENC support on the selected or automatically chosen Video Processing GPU at the requested output size. ProRes Proxy uses CPU-based 10-bit 4:2:2 encoding, although the verified Neural Rendering path remains RGBA8.

| Application setting | Choices and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| AI Processing GPU | Automatic or a compatible NVIDIA RTX GPU; used for Neural Rendering and Frame Generation |
| Video Processing GPU | Automatic or an available NVIDIA GPU; used only for codecs suffixed `(NVIDIA NVENC)`, while plain H.264/H.265/AV1 and ProRes stay on CPU |
| Preview Encoding | Auto (default), Always H.264, or Disabled; controls how in-app video previews are produced on the Video and Frame Interpolation tabs |
| DLSS 5 Architecture | Auto, Turing and higher, Ada Lovelace and higher, or Blackwell and higher; Auto selects the runtime build from the AI Processing GPU |
| Settings preset | Export all adjustable Image, Video, Frame Interpolation, GPU, HDR Mode, Preview Encoding, and DLSS 5 Architecture settings to JSON, or import a preset to apply and save them |

Saved GPU selections use stable GPU identity. If a previously saved GPU is no longer available, that selection returns to Automatic rather than silently switching to another saved device.
